Weather Prediction using multiple methods in R.

This work is done on the [weather analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/mastmustu/weather-analysis) dataset from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com).

The data-set includes over a decade worth of weather data in the Colorado area, with attributes such as the average, maximum and minimum daily temperatures, the rainfall, humidity, etc.

The code consists of pre-processing (time-shifting and tidying the data), exploratory data analysis and models for predicting temperature including (stepwise) linear regression, tree based methods and random forests.
